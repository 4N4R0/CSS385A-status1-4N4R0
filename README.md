  Then, everyone races to match that clue with a song. 
  Even if you don’t get it right, you can still earn points from others for close guesses or creative ideas. 
  The game celebrates how music connects us through shared memories, laughter, and a little friendly competition. 
  The Song Guessing Game isn’t just about winning. It’s about the songs that bring people together.
Synopsis:
  The Song Guessing Game is an online party game that mixes word guessing and music discovery. Each round, players take turns providing a word or lyric clue that is in a song, while other players race to guess it before time runs out. 
  The game combines creativity, nostalgia, and friendly competition. Players not only get points from guessing songs but also for clever or close responses. Through bright neon visuals, fast-paced rounds, and social feedback loops, The Song Guessing Game transforms music memories into shared laughter and rhythm-driven fun.
Objective:
  The primary objective of The Song Guessing Game is to guess the correct song and/or artist that matches the song clue provided by another player within the time limit and faster than other players.
  Secondary objectives:
  Earn bonus points for creative or funny guesses
  Build social engagement by rewarding other players for their clever connections
  Explore different genres and expand musical knowledge in a casual, playful environment
  Players compete to achieve the highest total score by the end of each and all rounds, but the real reward is the collective discovery and nostalgia of shared songs.
Brief Description of Mechanics:
  One player begins in a lobby screen and selects:
    Genre: Pop, Rock, 80s, Latin, etc.
    Number of Rounds: 3–10
    Number of Players: 2–8
    Clue Type: Single Word or Sentence Mode
  Then, they share the game room number/link to all other players. Then, each player enters one clue before the game begins.
  Each round follows this sequence:
    Clue Reveal:
      One player’s chosen clue appears at the top of the screen 
    Guessing Phase:
      All other players type their best song guess into a text box within 30 seconds
    Feedback and Peer Scoring Phase:
      Players can award 1–5 points to others for creative or nostalgic answers
    The system automatically checks lyrics or titles for matches and assigns points:
      Correct = +50
      Close Match (contains similar word, lyric, and/or singer) = +20
      Incorrect = +0
      Peer points = +1–5
    Transition to Next Round:
      A short clip of a song related to the clue plays as a transition to the next player’s turn
  After all rounds, the Results Screen displays:
    Top players and total points
    Special awards like “Most Creative Guess,” “Fastest Typer,” “Best Memory”
    Players can then choose to Play Again or return to the Lobby
